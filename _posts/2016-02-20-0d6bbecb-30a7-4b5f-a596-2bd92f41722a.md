Leaf Watershed

A watershed is a basin-like 
landform defined by highpoints and ridgelines that descend into lower 
elevations and stream valleys. A watershed carries water "shed" from 
the land after rain falls and snow melts. Drop by drop, water is 
channeled into soils, groundwaters, creeks, and streams, making its way 
to larger rivers and eventually the sea. Water is a universal solvent, 
affected by all that it comes in contact with: the land it traverses, 
and the soils through which it travels. The important thing about 
watersheds is: what we do on the land affects water quality for all 
communities living downstream.
