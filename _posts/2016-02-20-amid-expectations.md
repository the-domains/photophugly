Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to perform photosynthesis.
Plants can differentiate and develop in response to light (known as 
photomorphogenesis), which allows plants to optimize their use of light 
and space. Plants use light to track time, which is known as 
photoperiodism. They can tell the time of day and time of year by 
sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight. Light can also elicit
a directional response in plants that allows them to grow toward, or 
even away from, light; this is known as phototropism.
