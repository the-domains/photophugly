**Fugu** is the Japanese word for pufferfish and the dish prepared from it, normally species of genus _Takifugu_, _Lagocephalus_, or _Sphoeroides_, or porcupinefish of the genus _Diodon_. Fugu can be lethally poisonous due to its tetrodioxin; therefore, it must be carefully prepared to remove toxic parts and to avoid contaminating the meat. The restaurant preparation of fugu is strictly controlled by law in 
Japan and several other countries, and only chefs who have qualified 
after three or more years of rigorous training are allowed to prepare 
the fish. Domestic preparation occasionally leads to accidental death.
